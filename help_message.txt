*Welcome!*
This bot is designed to protect your chat.

List of available commands:
/start and /help - display this welcome message (works only in private messages with the bot).

For chat administrators:
/captcha - enable/disable captcha when joining the chat.
/attack - activate/deactivate attack mode.

In attack mode, all new chat participants receive a temporary 5-minute ban. This command is useful during a mass invasion of spammers in the chat.
